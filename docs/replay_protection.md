# Replay Protection and Idempotency for Charges

This document describes how the subscription vault prevents double-charging and how off-chain billing engines should integrate with it.

## Overview

Charge operations (`charge_subscription` and, internally, each item in `batch_charge`) are protected against:

1. **Replay**: Charging the same billing period more than once.
2. **Idempotent retries**: Allowing the same logical charge to be submitted multiple times (e.g. network retry) without double-debiting.

Storage usage is kept bounded: one period index and one ring buffer of up to 64 idempotency key hashes per subscription.

## Mechanisms

### Period-based key (always on)

- For each subscription we record the **last charged billing period** as `period_index = now / interval_seconds` (integer division).
- Before charging we require that the current period has not already been charged. If it has, the contract returns `Error::Replay`.
- After a successful charge we store the current `period_index` for that subscription.
- **Storage**: One `u64` per subscription (key: `DataKey::ChargedPeriod(subscription_id)`).

### Optional idempotency key (caller-provided)

Three entrypoints accept an optional idempotency key:

| Entrypoint | Domain constant |
|---|---|
| `charge_subscription` | `DOMAIN_CHARGE_INTERVAL = 0` |
| `deposit_funds` | `DOMAIN_DEPOSIT_FUNDS = 1` |
| `charge_one_off` | `DOMAIN_CHARGE_ONEOFF = 2` |

- Each entrypoint accepts an `idem_key: Option<BytesN<32>>`.
- If the caller supplies a key and we have already recorded the **hash** of `(domain, subscription_id, key)` for this subscription, we return the success variant without modifying state (idempotent no-op).
- If the key is new, the normal checks run, the operation executes, and the hashed key is appended to the ring buffer.

#### Key hashing

The raw caller-supplied key is **never stored directly**. Instead, the contract computes:

```
hash = SHA256(domain || subscription_id || raw_key)
```

where `domain` is a 4-byte big-endian `u32`, `subscription_id` is a 4-byte big-endian `u32`, and `raw_key` is the 32-byte caller-supplied value. This ensures:

- The same raw key used on two different entrypoints produces different on-chain fingerprints.
- The same raw key used on two different subscriptions produces different fingerprints.
- No raw key material is visible in storage to indexers.

#### Ring buffer

- Hashes are stored in an `IdemRingBuffer` struct capped at `IDEM_HISTORY = 64` entries per subscription.
- Each entry stores `(hash, inserted_at_timestamp)`. On lookup, entries older than `IDEM_TTL_SECS = 7 days` are skipped and treated as absent, regardless of ring position.
- A `cursor` field tracks where the next entry will be written. When the buffer is full, the oldest entry (by ring position) is silently overwritten (cursor wraps around).
- **Storage**: One `IdemRingBuffer` per subscription (key: `DataKey::IdemKey(subscription_id)`).
- **Combined guarantee**: An attacker must submit 64 distinct charges to the same subscription *within a 7-day window* to cycle out a single hash. This is infeasible under any normal subscription billing cadence.

### Batch charge

- `batch_charge(subscription_ids)` does **not** take idempotency keys. Each subscription is charged with period-based replay protection only. Duplicate IDs in the list are processed independently (each may succeed or fail per period/balance/interval).

## Integrator responsibilities

1. **Use one idempotency key per billing event.** For a given subscription and billing period, use a single stable key (e.g. derived from `subscription_id` + period start or from your job id). Retries with the same key are safe; using a new key for the same period will be rejected as `Replay` once the period was already charged.

2. **Do not reuse keys across periods or entrypoints.** Use a new key for each new billing period so that the next charge is not mistaken for a replay of the previous period. The domain-separated hashing scheme prevents cross-entrypoint collisions, but best practice is still to use unique keys per event.

3. **Handle `Error::Replay`.** If you receive `Replay`, the charge for that period was already applied (by this or a previous request). Treat as success for reporting; do not retry with a different key for the same period.

4. **Handle idempotent no-op.** If you receive `Ok` but did not observe the corresponding on-chain event (e.g. your indexer missed it), the operation still succeeded. The contract does not re-emit events on idempotent matches; verify against the ring buffer off-chain if needed.

5. **Optional but recommended:** Persist idempotency keys in your billing engine (e.g. per subscription and period) so that retries use the same key.

6. **Retry window.** Idempotency entries expire after 7 days (`IDEM_TTL_SECS`). Retries must use the same key within that window. After 7 days (or after 64 newer operations on the same subscription, whichever comes first), the oldest hash is evicted and a retry with that key would be processed as a fresh operation.

## Required parameters and behavior (Rustdoc summary)

- **`charge_subscription(env, subscription_id, idem_key)`**
  - `idem_key`: `Option<BytesN<32>>`. Use `Some(key)` for safe retries; use `None` for period-only protection.
  - Returns `Ok(ChargeExecutionResult::Charged)` on success or idempotent match (same key already processed).
  - Returns `Err(Error::Replay)` if this billing period was already charged (and the call did not match a stored idempotency key).

- **`deposit_funds(env, subscription_id, subscriber, amount, idem_key)`**
  - `idem_key`: `Option<BytesN<32>>`. Use `Some(key)` for safe retries.
  - Returns `Ok(())` on success or idempotent match.

- **`charge_one_off(env, subscription_id, merchant, amount, idem_key)`**
  - `idem_key`: `Option<BytesN<32>>`. Use `Some(key)` for safe retries.
  - Returns `Ok(())` on success or idempotent match.

## Residual risks and mitigations

- **Clock skew / timestamp manipulation:** Period is derived from ledger timestamp. Validators set ledger time; contract does not rely on caller-provided time. Mitigation: trust the network's ledger timestamp.
- **Unbounded growth:** Only one period index and one `IdemRingBuffer` (≤ 64 entries × (32 + 8) bytes = ~2,560 bytes per subscription) are stored. No unbounded growth from replay protection.
- **Key collision:** If an integrator reuses the same 32-byte key for two different billing periods on the same entrypoint, the second period's charge would be treated as idempotent (return Ok without charging). Mitigation: derive keys from period (e.g. include period start or index in the key).
- **Ring buffer eviction:** A retry delayed by more than 7 days (or after 64 newer operations on the same subscription) will miss the ring buffer and execute as a fresh charge. Use `None` or keep retries within the TTL window.
- **Cross-entrypoint safety:** Domain separation in the hash prevents the same raw key from replaying across `charge_subscription`, `deposit_funds`, and `charge_one_off`.

## Admin-operation nonce scheme

Privileged admin operations (`batch_charge` and `rotate_admin`) carry an additional layer of replay protection through an explicit, domain-separated, monotonic nonce scheme.

### Design

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Nonce type | `u64` (unsigned, monotonic) |
| Per-signer | One counter per `(signer: Address, domain: u32)` pair |
| Storage | Persistent storage, key `DataKey::AdminNonce(Address, u32)` |
| Initial value | `0` (absent key treated as `0`) |
| Enforcement | Caller provides the *current* stored value; contract checks equality, then atomically increments |
| Error on mismatch | `Error::NonceAlreadyUsed` (code `1038`) |

### Domain constants

```rust
pub const DOMAIN_BATCH_CHARGE: u32 = 0;   // label: "batch"
pub const DOMAIN_ADMIN_ROTATION: u32 = 1;  // label: "adm_rot"
```

Domain separation ensures that a nonce consumed in one operation cannot interfere with another. The labels appear in the emitted event topic so indexers can filter by domain.

### Nonce consumption flow

```
caller → batch_charge(ids, nonce)
  1. require_stored_admin_auth()   // auth check first – fails fast on wrong signer
  2. check_and_advance(admin, DOMAIN_BATCH_CHARGE, nonce)
        a. read stored nonce (default 0)
        b. assert provided == stored  → Error::NonceAlreadyUsed if not
        c. write stored + 1
        d. emit NonceConsumedEvent
  3. … rest of charge logic
```

### Emitted event

Every successful nonce consumption emits a `NonceConsumedEvent`:

```rust
pub struct NonceConsumedEvent {
    pub signer:    Address,  // the admin address that consumed the nonce
    pub domain:    u32,      // DOMAIN_BATCH_CHARGE or DOMAIN_ADMIN_ROTATION
    pub nonce:     u64,      // the consumed (previous) nonce value
    pub timestamp: u64,      // ledger timestamp at consumption
}
```

Event topic: `("nonce_consumed", signer, domain_label)` where `domain_label` is the human-readable symbol (`"batch"` or `"adm_rot"`).

### Off-chain integration

Use `get_admin_nonce(signer, domain) -> u64` to read the expected nonce before submitting a transaction:

```rust
// Pseudocode
let next_nonce = client.get_admin_nonce(&admin, DOMAIN_BATCH_CHARGE);
client.batch_charge(&subscription_ids, &next_nonce);
```

To prevent races, integrate this with a serialised job queue or use optimistic concurrency: if `NonceAlreadyUsed` is returned, re-read the nonce and retry.

### Security properties

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Cross-ledger replay | Nonce is monotonic; replaying any past transaction fails with `NonceAlreadyUsed` |
| Out-of-order submission | Only the exact stored value is accepted; skipping nonce values is rejected |
| Cross-domain replay | Domain tag is part of storage key; batch_charge nonce and rotate_admin nonce are fully independent |
| Cross-signer replay | Signer address is part of storage key; each admin has its own counter |
| Nonce overflow | `checked_add(1)` panics (transaction aborted) rather than wrapping to 0 |
| Auth bypass via nonce manipulation | Auth check (`require_admin_auth`) runs *before* nonce check; invalid signers are rejected without advancing any counter |

### Storage layout

```
Persistent storage:
  DataKey::AdminNonce(Address, 0) → u64   (batch_charge nonce for address)
  DataKey::AdminNonce(Address, 1) → u64   (rotate_admin nonce for address)
```

Nonce entries are stored in **persistent** storage so they survive ledger TTL extension and contract upgrades. Growth is bounded: one `u64` entry per `(signer, domain)` pair. In practice this means at most two entries per admin address (one per domain).

## Admin-operation nonce scheme

Privileged admin operations (`batch_charge` and `rotate_admin`) carry an additional layer of replay protection through an explicit, domain-separated, monotonic nonce scheme.

| Initial value | `0` (absent key treated as `0`) |
| Enforcement | Caller provides the *current* stored value; contract checks equality, then atomically increments |
| Error on mismatch | `Error::NonceAlreadyUsed` (code `1038`) |

### Domain constants

```rust
pub const DOMAIN_BATCH_CHARGE: u32 = 0;   // label: "batch"
pub const DOMAIN_ADMIN_ROTATION: u32 = 1;  // label: "adm_rot"
```

Domain separation ensures that a nonce consumed in one operation cannot interfere with another. The labels appear in the emitted event topic so indexers can filter by domain.

### Nonce consumption flow

```
caller → batch_charge(ids, nonce)
  1. require_stored_admin_auth()   // auth check first – fails fast on wrong signer
  2. check_and_advance(admin, DOMAIN_BATCH_CHARGE, nonce)
       a. read stored nonce (default 0)
       b. assert provided == stored  → Error::NonceAlreadyUsed if not
       c. write stored + 1
       d. emit NonceConsumedEvent
  3. … rest of charge logic
```

### Emitted event

Every successful nonce consumption emits a `NonceConsumedEvent`:

```rust
pub struct NonceConsumedEvent {
    pub signer:    Address,  // the admin address that consumed the nonce
    pub domain:    u32,      // DOMAIN_BATCH_CHARGE or DOMAIN_ADMIN_ROTATION
    pub nonce:     u64,      // the consumed (previous) nonce value
    pub timestamp: u64,      // ledger timestamp at consumption
}
```

Event topic: `("nonce_consumed", signer, domain_label)` where `domain_label` is the human-readable symbol (`"batch"` or `"adm_rot"`).

### Off-chain integration

Use `get_admin_nonce(signer, domain) -> u64` to read the expected nonce before submitting a transaction:

```rust
// Pseudocode
let next_nonce = client.get_admin_nonce(&admin, DOMAIN_BATCH_CHARGE);
client.batch_charge(&subscription_ids, &next_nonce);
```

To prevent races, integrate this with a serialised job queue or use optimistic concurrency: if `NonceAlreadyUsed` is returned, re-read the nonce and retry.

### Security properties

| Cross-signer replay | Signer address is part of storage key; each admin has its own counter |

```
Persistent storage:
  DataKey::AdminNonce(Address, 0) → u64   (batch_charge nonce for address)
