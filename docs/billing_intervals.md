# Billing Interval Enforcement

How `charge_subscription` validates and enforces timing between charges.

---

## Interval constraints

| Bound | Value | Constant |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Minimum | 60 s (1 minute) | `MIN_SUBSCRIPTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS` |
| Maximum | 31 536 000 s (365 days) | `MAX_SUBSCRIPTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS` |

`interval_seconds = 0` is implicitly rejected because zero is below the minimum.

Validation is performed by the single authoritative helper `validate_interval(interval_seconds)` at every entry point that persists an interval:

- `create_subscription` / `create_subscription_with_token`
- `create_plan_template` / `create_plan_template_with_token`
- `update_plan_template`

### Relationship to Stellar ledger close time

Stellar ledgers close roughly every **5 seconds** on mainnet, and the Soroban
ledger timestamp is stamped **once per ledger**. This creates two separate
concepts that are easy to conflate:

| Concept | Value | Enforced by |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Protocol-level floor — at least 1-2 ledger closes, so that `last_payment + interval` is representable as a distinct ledger timestamp | ~5-10 s | Stellar network |
| Contract-enforced floor (`MIN_SUBSCRIPTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS`) | **60 s** (≈ 12 ledger closes) | `validate_interval` |

The contract's floor is deliberately **stricter** than the protocol floor.
Choosing 60 s rather than 10 s buys a wide margin against ledger timestamp
jitter and equal-timestamp ledgers (see [Ledger time
monotonicity](#ledger-time-monotonicity)) at negligible cost to real
subscriptions, whose intervals are normally measured in days.

### Warning: sub-minute intervals are rejected

Any `interval_seconds` below 60 is rejected at creation with
`Error::InvalidInput` (3002), and plan templates are validated identically.
Practical consequences of this floor:

- **Do not model intervals in seconds.** A "per-minute" subscription is not
  expressible. Use the smallest interval the product actually needs —
  realistically a day or more.
- **Sub-minute periods cannot be charged at all.** Because the charge boundary
  is `now >= last_payment + interval`, an interval shorter than one ledger
  close would be unobservable: the ledger timestamp cannot advance finely
  enough to distinguish the start of the period from its end.
- **A rejected interval is not silently clamped.** Passing 30 does not become
  60; the call fails outright, so the merchant never believes it has a
  subscription that the contract will not honour.

## Canonical time-math formula

The **next allowed charge timestamp** is computed by the single helper:

```
next_charge_time(last_payment, interval) = last_payment + interval
```

Implemented via checked addition; returns `Err(Overflow)` if the result
would exceed `u64::MAX`.  In practice this cannot happen for validated
intervals (≤ 365 days) and real Stellar ledger timestamps.

Both the **charge path** (`charge_core.rs`) and the **query path**
(`queries.rs`) import this same function from `subscription.rs` so that
the boundary each enforces or displays is identical.

---

## Charge rule

A charge is allowed when:

```
env.ledger().timestamp() >= last_payment_timestamp + interval_seconds
```

The comparison is **inclusive** — a charge at exactly the boundary succeeds.
The comparison at exactly `last_payment_timestamp + interval_seconds - 1` fails.

### Outcomes

| Condition | Result | Storage |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `now < last_payment + interval` | `Error::IntervalNotElapsed` | Unchanged |
| `now >= last_payment + interval` | Ok | `last_payment_timestamp = now` |
| Subscription not Active/GracePeriod | `Error::NotActive` | Unchanged |
| Subscription not found | `Error::NotFound` | Unchanged |

---

## Timestamp source

All timing uses the Soroban ledger timestamp (`env.ledger().timestamp()`), a
Unix epoch value in seconds controlled by the Stellar validator network.

---

## Window reset

On success, `last_payment_timestamp` is set to the **current ledger
timestamp**, not `last_payment_timestamp + interval_seconds`.  This means
late charges shift the next window forward rather than allowing a cascade of
back-to-back catch-up charges.

### Example (30-day interval)

```
T0 = creation          → last_payment_timestamp = T0
T0 + 30d               → charge succeeds, last_payment_timestamp = T0 + 30d
T0 + 30d (immediate)   → retry rejected (IntervalNotElapsed)
T0 + 60d               → next charge succeeds
```

---

## First charge

`last_payment_timestamp` is initialised to `env.ledger().timestamp()` at
subscription creation, so the first charge cannot occur until
`interval_seconds` later.

---

## Ledger time monotonicity

Soroban ledger timestamps are set by Stellar validators and are expected to be
**non-decreasing** across ledger closes (~5-6 s on mainnet).  The contract does
**not** assume strict monotonicity — it only checks
`now >= last_payment_timestamp + interval_seconds`.  Consequences:

- If two consecutive ledgers share the same timestamp, a charge that just
  succeeded will simply be rejected on the next call because `0 < interval_seconds`.
- The contract never compares the current timestamp to a "previous ledger
  timestamp"; it only compares against its own stored `last_payment_timestamp`.

---

## Timestamp regression safety

Ledger timestamps may move **backward** in practice during:
- Network reorgs / ledger rewinds in test harnesses.
- Soroban host upgrades that reset validator time.
- Deliberate fuzz/chaos testing.

All timestamp subtraction in this contract uses **saturating arithmetic** to
guarantee safety:

| Expression | Location | Regression behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `now.saturating_sub(sub.start_time)` | `charge_core.rs` | Saturates to 0 → period 0 |
| `now.saturating_sub(state.last_usage_timestamp)` | `charge_core.rs` | elapsed = 0 → burst limit enforced |
| `now.saturating_sub(sub.start_time) / interval` | `charge_core.rs` | period_index = 0 |
| `grace_start.saturating_add(grace_duration)` | `charge_core.rs`, `queries.rs` | No overflow |
| `last_payment.checked_add(interval)` | `subscription.rs` | Returns `Err(Overflow)` on wrap |

### Backward-jump semantics

A **backward jump** (now < last_payment_timestamp) is treated as *"no time has
passed"*:

- `next_charge_time(last_payment, interval) = last_payment + interval`
- Since `now < last_payment <= last_payment + interval`, the guard `now >= next`
  evaluates to `false` → `Error::IntervalNotElapsed` is returned.
- No storage is mutated; `last_payment_timestamp` is unchanged.
- This is the **correct conservative** behaviour: missing a charge window is
  recoverable (retry later); a spurious charge caused by wrap-around would be
  a funds-loss bug.

---

## Security notes

### Double-charge prevention

The boundary check `now >= last + interval` uses checked addition, so there
is no risk of wrap-around confusion.  The integer division-based replay guard
(`period_index = now / interval`) provides a second, independent barrier
against charging twice within the same period.

### Overflow

`next_charge_time` uses `u64::checked_add` and propagates `Error::Overflow`
rather than silently wrapping.  The maximum interval (365 days) means the
furthest future timestamp that can be stored is
`u64::MAX_REALISTIC_TIMESTAMP + 365 days`, which is far below `u64::MAX`
for any foreseeable ledger.

The query path (`compute_next_charge_info`) calls the same helper and uses
`saturating_add` on the (unreachable) overflow path so that display code always
receives a valid timestamp without panicking.
